# AWS Multi-Tier Architecture 🚀

✅ **Project Overview**
This project implements a **highly scalable** and **secure** AWS **Multi-Tier Architecture** with separate **presentation, application, and database layers**.

The architecture is designed for **high availability (HA)**, **scalability**, and **security** by leveraging AWS services such as **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling, RDS, and VPC**.

### **🏗️ Architecture Components**
1. **Presentation Layer (Web Tier)**
   - **Amazon Route 53** - Domain Name System (DNS) for domain routing.
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.
   - **Amazon S3 + CloudFront** - For serving static assets.

2. **Application Layer**
   - **Amazon EC2 (Auto Scaling Group)** - Scalable compute instances for backend logic.
   - **Amazon Elastic Beanstalk** (Optional) - For easy deployment and management.
   - **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** - For managing instance configurations.

3. **Database Layer**
   - **Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** - Managed relational database.
   - **Amazon DynamoDB** (Optional) - NoSQL database for session storage.

4. **Security & Networking**
   - **Amazon VPC** - Private networking with isolated subnets.
   - **Security Groups & NACLs** - Fine-grained network security.
   - **AWS WAF & Shield** - Protection against web attacks.

✅ **Services Used**  
- **Compute:** EC2, Auto Scaling, Elastic Beanstalk
- **Storage:** S3, RDS, DynamoDB
- **Networking:** VPC, ALB, Route 53
- **Security:** IAM, Security Groups, WAF
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch, CloudTrail
- **CDN:** AWS CloudFront

✅ **Deployment Steps**  

### **Step 1: Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aws-multi-tier.git
cd aws-multi-tier
```

### **Step 2: Deploy the Infrastructure**
You can deploy this architecture using **Terraform**, **AWS CloudFormation**, or **AWS CDK**.

#### **Option 1: Terraform Deployment**
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

#### **Option 2: AWS CloudFormation**
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name MultiTierStack --template-body file://cloudformation.yaml
```

### **Step 3: Deploy the Application**
- Upload frontend static assets to **S3**.
- Deploy backend application on **EC2 instances** or **Elastic Beanstalk**.
- Connect the application to **RDS** for database operations.

## 📌 Best Practices
✅ Use **IAM roles and policies** instead of hardcoding credentials.  
✅ Enable **Auto Scaling** to handle traffic fluctuations.  
✅ Use **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.  
✅ Implement **AWS WAF** to protect against attacks.  
✅ Enable **Multi-AZ deployment** for RDS for high availability.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implement **AWS Lambda** for serverless processing.  
- Add **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)** for caching.  
- Deploy using **AWS CDK** for infrastructure as code.
